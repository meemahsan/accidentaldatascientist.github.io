## Introduction
In my 15+ years of experience in data analytics and data science space for multinational companies, I have seen first hand how difficult B2B selling has gotten. It requires specialized knowledge both from seller & buyer perspective as the product & services at play are complex. Usually multiple stakeholders and decision makers from various parts of the org are involved. And very often it is difficult to get them to come to an consensus. And because multiple stake holders and different parts of the org are involved, the sales cycle can be very long. The stakes are a lot higher as the purchase price is higher. The buying decision is often also dependent on the current economic situation as companies are unwilling to invest a lot on new product during unstable economic condition. And when you combine all this….there is plenty of room for mistake.

## B2B Sales Funnel

This is how a typical sales funnel looks like. There are 6 main steps - awareness, interest, consideration, intent, evaluation and purchase. B2B and B2C sales funnel looks exactly the same but yet there are a lot of differences. For example, currently I am in the market for a new cell phone. I will be researching and learning about various new cell phones. I will read reviews and try to gauge which cell phone has all the features that I am looking for. Once I have decided on a cell phone, I will go on the app or website and add the specific cell phone to my shopping cart. I will do a last-minute check on my shopping cart and voila I have a new cell phone coming my way. This whole process will take me somewhere from half an hour to a few days depending on how busy my schedule is. However, for B2B sales it will be much different. For example, there will be a lot more time spent doing research. And multiple departments have to be involved. Multiple decision makers from various departments have to be on board, finance dept has to approve the budget, procurement dept has to negotiate the price, etc. So, the overall process is much lengthy and complicated. And there is a lot of uncertainty that is involved. And that's why the job of a typical b2b sales person has gotten very difficult.

## B2B Sales Past vs Present
The"how" and " when" a b2b sales person interacts with a potential customer has changed drastically in the last decade or so. In the past, marketing teams were in charge of raising awareness and interest about products and the rest of the funnel was driven by sales effort. So B2B sales teams had more time to engage with the prospective customer to get them interested in products and services
However, due to the advance in technology, we are doing most of our research in digital space. Hence most of the sales funnel is driven by marketing teams. By the time, a potential customer has reached out for a specific product or service , they have done a lot of research. So, sales team does not have as much time to persuade them to evaluate the product or service. And that's why the interaction between a b2b salesperson and a prospective customer has to be more targeted, precise and meaningful because the window of opportunity to peak the client's interest is very small. And this is why more and more B2B companies are adopting data science & big data to transform their sales teams & processes.

## Customer Segmentation
One size does not fit all…Client needs varies by business size, geographic location, industry and business tenure. And keep in mind that an average b2b potential customer does not have much time while they are doing product research. They don't have time to hear about all the wonderful products that are in market. They want to hear about a few options that might be a good fit for their needs. And that's why it is so important to have specific customer segments. Internal CRM data, external 3rd party data and demographic data from Bureau of Labor stat or census website can be used to run machine learning algorithms to build out meaningful customer segments. It helps recommend best product & services that cater to each & every client’s unique need. It also helps salespeople spend less time in cold calling & prospecting and spend more time in having meaningful engagement with clients. 

## Buyer Intent
Just because a product or service is a good fit for a company does not guarantee a b2b sales. And that's where buyer intent data comes into play. It is aggregated dataset that leverages ML algos to show which companies are actively researching on specific products & services or in other words are in active buying cycle. By identifying how many users from a specific company are researching relevant topics, their content consumption benchmarked against certain time, it is possible to develop pre-purchase buyer intent or signal. It helps identify which companies are looking to make the switch. Hence helps sales teams be more productive by not having to cold call companies that are unwilling to have a selling conversation. I know it sounds a bit intrusive. But there are a lot of third-party companies that provide buyer intent data using ethical ai practices while operating within the constraints of current privacy laws.

## Automation of tedious tasks
Being a data science leader within B2B Sales space, I have firsthand experience of how a B2B sales teams often struggle with all the tedious tasks that is involved.
Once a company is in a buying cycle, the process is much longer. It requires multiple check points, follow up emails and reminders. There are ML tools that integrate directly with CRM and makes day to day mundane sales tasks easier.
There are tools that help with task list, follow up calls that need to be made, optimize your sales driving route. Some of them leverage NLP while a call is taking place and even jots down the takeaways and follow up items. They automatically add reminders in calendar. For example, a customer might be very interested but might have said ‘let’s talk in two months when it’s renewal time”. These tools will automatically put a reminder on the calendar without the salesperson having to do anything. In other words, sales team can just focus on the customer and have an engaging conversation without having to worry about note taking or adding reminders to calendars. It helps sales teams gain access, generate more in sales pipeline and thus increase productivity. As for customers, it helps to strengthen customer relationship and bolster trust.

## Coaching and development
It's very important to develop sales skills by leveraging ongoing coaching and development. And most b2b salespeople receive coaching from their leaders regularly. However, it is more static in nature. So, the coaching and development might happen during 1:1 conversation or when performance discussions are happening. Currently there are Machine Learning tools that analyze video calls or phone calls between salespeople and prospective buyer to provide them with instantaneous coaching and feedback based on data driven machine learning algorithms. It helps to sharpen skill set of seasoned salespeople and makes it easier to onboard new hires. These tools provide sales teams with best of training and coaching and insights so that they can perform at their best. Better sales teams equate to better interaction between b2b seller and buyer. So, it's a win-win situation.

## Conclusion
In summary, data science is transforming B2B sales by making sales teams more productive, time efficient, personalize their interaction with prospective clients and thus improving the whole b2b buying and selling process.
