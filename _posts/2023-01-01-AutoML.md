## What is AutoML?
AutoML is one of the most popular sub field of machine learning right now. AutoML attempts to automate stages of Machine Learning. A regular ML workflow includes data prep, that is data cleaning, normalization/scaling, transformation, feature extraction & engineering, model training, hyperparameter optimization, model validation and deployment. AutoML tries to automate all these facets. In other words, AutoML speeds up the process of model build without having to try individual algorithm one by one. 

_AutoML claims to automate the entire ML workflow_

## How is it used in the industry?
There are both open source python libraries and commercial software available today that can be used to run automl. And AutoML is used both by seasoned and new data scientists. For experienced data scientists, automl can help automate manual tasks such as feature engineering, selection and hyperparameter tuning. In this way, they have more time available to dive deeper into more complex problems. As for entry level data scientists, at times it gives them a preliminary model that they can fine tune further to build a robust and high performing model.
 
## How has it evolved over the last decade?
AutoML has been around for at least two decades. Now a days it is becoming increasingly popular because we have access to computers with superior processing power. In the early days, automl consisted of parameter tuning and limited model selection. Whereas, modern automl aims to automate the entire ML workflow. So it has come a long way since it's early days
 
## Pros & Cons
**Pros**
1. Speed. You get results and models faster
2. Saves resources because you don't have to keep on trying various algorithms
3. Gives you a good starting model

**Cons**
1. Inflexible. Not good for complex datasets and problems
2. Hard to interpret
3. Unpredictable performance. Sometimes might be good. Sometimes bad. Might not be a robust model
o	The model might be biased
o	Not scale-able for larger datasets 
 
## Will AutoML replace data scientists?
I think of AutoML as a productivity tool, something, that actually empowers data scientists by automating tedious and repetitive tasks. You still need a data scientist to translate the business problem to data science language, use domain knowledge to generate useful features, look under the hood to understand what the model is doing, find nuggets of information that automl won't be able to do and draw actionable insights.

## What does the future look like for AutoML?
1. AutoML data cleaning process will get better and better. It will be able to handle cleaning even for unstructured data
2. Most automl tools are slow for larger datasets. In the future, we will be able to scale it for larger datasets as well
3. It will change the practice of data scienceâ€¦we will be focusing less on ml workflow and more on asking the right questions and finding the right answers.
