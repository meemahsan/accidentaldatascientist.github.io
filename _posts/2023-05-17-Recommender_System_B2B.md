## What is it?
In today’s day and age, B2B companies are always on the lookout for ways to optimize their selling process and increase revenue. B2B companies can offer their clients the “next best product to buy” by leveraging a recommender system. A recommender system uses available data and machine learning algorithm to predict and offer the best product/services for a specific client. Recommender systems are very commonly used in B2C companies, specifically in Ecommerce, retailers, media and social networking. Recommender systems leverage the power of machine learning algorithms and big data to pair up the correct product and services to the right customer base.

## Why do we need a different approach compared to B2C?
Identifying the next best product for a B2C customer is a lot easier than a B2B customer as it involves pairing up the correct product to an individual consumer’s needs or requirement. Whereas, B2B buying process involves multiple stakeholders and usually involve a very lengthy process. Furthermore, the entire process is very sensitive to macro-economic variables. As a result, it is very difficult to analyze and find the “next best product” model for B2C companies. B2B recommender system requires a comprehensive data collection, exploratory data analysis and a complex model build process. Additionally, the machine learning models has to be monitored closely as they tend to drift often due to the complexity of the B2B busines ecosystem.

## What are the benefits of using recommender system?
1.	Increase sales: Recommender system can identify products and service that are relevant to a client’s specific needs. This makes the buying process easier for companies and they might have a higher likelihood to purchase.
2.	Optimize time and resources: Recommender systems can make sales team more productive by cutting down on research time and offering them a prioritized list of companies that are more likely to purchase from them. This saves time and resources, and salespeople can spend more time in connecting with their customer in a more meaningful way.
3.	Improve customer experience and engagement: Recommender system can improve customer satisfaction by offering a list of products that are more likely to suit their needs. In doing this, they show that the B2B company understands their customer’s needs and dedicated to meeting their needs in the present and the future. Thus it can help bolster customer satisfaction, build loyalty and create strong business bond


## What are different recommender systems?
B2B companies can use various recommender systems for their customer base based on their use case and criteria. Here are most commonly used recommender systems:
1.	Content based recommender system: Content based recommender system uses product features that recommend “similar” products to users. It analyzes product specific data to identify products that are similar to the products that the user is interested in.
2.	Collaborative filtering recommender system: This kind of system leverages user behavior, activities, past purchases and engagement data to predict what kind of product a person will like. In other words, it predicts what a person would like based on past behavior and activities of “similar users”.
3.	Hybrid recommender system: This type of system combines both content-based and collaborative-filtering approaches to generate recommendations for the user. Hybrid recommender system is the most commonly used system for B2B companies. Since, multiple stakeholders are involved in the selling process, it’s very important to use all available pertinent data for the model.

## What kind of datasets can be used to build a Hybrid recommender system for B2B sales team?
1. Customer/B2B Company data: All kinds of firmographic and technographic data can be used. For example, company growth, employee size, benefit plan, turnover rate etc. 
2. Demographic data: Publicly available data from BLS or Census data regarding median income and population density for the company location
3. Product Data: Product feature and attributes related data
4. Buyer Intent: 3rd party Buyer Intent data from publisher network of websites and 2nd Party data from B2B review websites
5. Engagement Data: Interaction on website, campaign response and webinar/events attendance data

## Conclusion
In today’s competitive environment, companies should constantly be ideating and strategizing to improve their sales process. By taking advantage of a hybrid recommender system, companies can offer a personalized and targeted selling process to their customers. In doing so, they can demonstrate their understanding of customers’ needs and their commitment to meet them in the future.
