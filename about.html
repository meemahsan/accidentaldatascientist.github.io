<p>I am a data science leader in tech space with 15+ years of Data Science & Analytics experience. My areas of expertise include and not limited to Sales & Marketing, Life Sciences and CPG industries.</p>

<p>I graduated with Bachelor in Finance, Mathematics and Economics from Saint Elizabeth's College. My heart was set on working on Wall Street after graduation. However, the universe had other plans. I graduated during the Recession and jobs in finance industry were hard to come by, especially for recent college graduates. I ended up taking a job in Technical Data Management at Cadbury Adams. Over there I met a statistican who inspired me to go back to graduate school for a degree in Applied Mathematics and the rest is history. Since then I have worked at a diverse set of companies ranging from start ups to Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p> In my spare time, I love to travel, garden and hike. </p>
